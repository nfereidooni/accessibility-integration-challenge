## Description: 
This project is part of a frontend developer challenge for Prepr.
The objective was to recreate the accessibility floating window at https://preprlabs.org/ using any framework (I chose React).
    
Additional Objectives:
- All mouseover effects need to work. But you only need to implement the following click events: close window, change position, language option(doesn’t need to be actually switching language), toggle ON/OFF buttons(doesn’t need to be actually applying changes), reset settings, search field(only need to respond to keyboard input)
- Select only 2 rows of elements in each adjustments section to present in your solution, you do not need to include all elements.
- The design needs to be responsive.
- Feel free to re-design the layout to showcase your creativity.
